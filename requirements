You need the entire pysustain folder from the below url to run these notebooks
https://github.com/ucl-pond/pySuStaIn.git
Upload and run the notebooks in the notebook folder of the pysustain folder and all functionality should be there
I'm using each pysustain folder from above as a separate environment, but I'm only uploading the notebooks changes I run or edit
