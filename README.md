# sustain_1
# This is a repo for my first timem working with sustain 
# its going to contain 1 environment for working with z score sustain. It will contain 2 things:

# 1] The sustain workshop with their synthetic data and z score sustain running
# 2] The adjusted sustain workshop which runs the same z score sustain but instead on synthetic data thats meant match whats coming from the CTE center

# hope im doing this correctly!
